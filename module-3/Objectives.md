# Welcome back to the next step in your TypeScript journey! 

In this module,Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a powerful paradigm that allows you to structure your code in a more modular and maintainable way. Here's what you'll explore:

### Module-3.1:Introduction of Object Oriented Programming

We will introduce you to object oriented programming.You'll learn what OOP is and how OOP principles help structure and maintain complex code bases.


### Module-3.2:Classes in TypeScript

Classes serve as blueprints for creating objects, which are instances that encapsulate both state and behavior. You'll learn how to define classes with properties and methods, create objects from them, and understand why this pattern is crucial for building scalable and maintainable applications.


### Module-3.3:Inheritance in TypeScript

Continuing our exploration of Object-Oriented Programming, we will let talk about inheritance, one of the most powerful tools for code reuse. Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, creating a parent-child relationship.


### Module-3.4:Polymorphism in TypeScript

When working with dynamic types, it's crucial to ensure that you're dealing with the expected type. TypeScript offers type guards to help with this. In this module, you'll explore how to use the type of operator to check the type of a variable at runtime, providing a safe way to implement conditional logic based on variable types. 


### Module-3.5:Abstract Classes and Interfaces in TypeScript

Building on your knowledge of type guards, this video introduces instance of, a powerful operator that allows you to check whether an object is an instance of a specific class. This is particularly useful in OOP, where objects might belong to different classes in an inheritance hierarchy. 


### Module-3.6:Encapsulation in TypeScript

Access modifiers are a key concept in Object-Oriented Programming, allowing you to control the visibility of class properties and methods. In this module, you'll learn about the different access modifiers in TypeScript


### Module-3.7:Getter and setter

Take control of how your class properties are accessed and modified! You'll learn how to define getters and setters in TypeScript and explore their benefits


### Module-3.8:Statics in OOP

Static properties and methods belong to the class itself, not to individual instances. We'll explore the concept of static members in TypeScript, showing you how to declare and use them.


### Module-3.9:Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming that allows different classes to be treated as if they are the same through a common interface or base class. In this module, you'll learn how to implement polymorphism in TypeScript.


### Module-3.10:Abstraction in OOP

Abstraction allows you to hide complex implementation details behind a simple interface, providing a cleaner and more focused interaction with code. In this module, you'll learn how to use abstract classes and interfaces in TypeScript to create high-level blueprints. 


### Module-3.11:Encapsulation in OOP

Encapsulation is the practice of restricting access to certain parts of a class, ensuring that internal details remain hidden from external code. We will delve into encapsulation in TypeScript, demonstrating how to use access modifiers, private properties, and other techniques to safeguard your code's internal state.
