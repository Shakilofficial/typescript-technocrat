# Module-3.Object-Oriented Programming in TypeScript

## Introduction of Object Oriented Programming:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects to represent and manipulate data. It is a powerful approach to software development that allows for modular and reusable code. OOP is based on the concept of classes, which are blueprints for creating objects.

In OOP, objects are instances of classes. A class defines the properties and behaviors that an object can have. For example, a class called "Person" might have properties like "name" and "age", and behaviors like "walk" and "talk".

OOP is a fundamental concept in software development, and TypeScript is a powerful language that supports OOP. In this module, we will explore the basics of OOP in TypeScript, including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation, and more.
